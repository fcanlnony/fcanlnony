### Hi there 👋
 
* I'm a student from China majoring in Electronic and Information Engineering. I'm a noob developer using the C language, and i am currently working on Verilog. I am also developing multi-rotor drones. English isn't my first language, please tolerate my faulty grammar.🥲
* My username fcanlnony is just a combination of my nickname translated into English and F-CAN-L-NON-Y by fly, cannon. Shus is a portmanteau of another nickname I had in high school.
* OS & Test Platform: openSUSE Tumbleweed
