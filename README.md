### Hi there 👋
 
* I'm a freshman from China. I'm a noob developer using the C language, and i am currently working on C. English isn't my first language, please tolerate my faulty grammar😊.
* My username fcanlnony is just a combination of my nickname translated into English and F-CAN-L-NON-Y by fly, cannon. Shus is a portmanteau of another nickname I had in high school.
* OS & Test Platform: openSUSE Tumbleweed
