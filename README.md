### Hi there 👋
 
* My name is Shus Mo, and I'm an Electronic and Information Engineering student from China. I'm an inexperienced developer who uses the C language, and I am currently working on Verilog. I also develop multi-rotor drones. English isn't my first language, so please excuse my grammatical errors.🥲
* My username, fcanlnony, is a combination of my nickname, translated into English, and "fly cannon." Shus is a portmanteau of another nickname I had in high school.
